# Lab Instructions: Type Casting Input

In this lab, you will practice using explicit type casting to ensure that user input data is correctly processed by your scripts. You'll work on two exercises, each focused on a different scenario that demonstrates the importance of handling data types in Python.

### **Before You Begin**

> #### Tips for Viewing Instructions Side-by-Side with Code
> - To view this README file in Preview mode, right-click on `README.md` and select `Open Preview`.
> - Arrange your workspace:
>   - **VSCode Toolbar**: Go to `View -> Editor Layout -> Two Columns`.
>   - Open `README.md` in one column and the code file in the other.
> - To run Python code, select your Python file in the file tree and:
>   - Right-click and choose **Run Python File in Terminal**, or
>   - Use the play button in the top-right, selecting **Run Python File in Terminal**.
> - For more on using VSCode, see our [support resources](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-in-python/supplement/2IEyt/visual-studio-code-on-coursera).

## Lab Objectives

1. **Exercise 1**: Apply explicit type casting to user-inputted variables to ensure they are in the correct data type.
2. **Exercise 2**: Use type casting to calculate and display an accurate total bill from user input values.

---

## Exercise 1: Type Casting for User-Inputted Variables

In this exercise, you will work with user inputs, casting each variable to its appropriate type as specified in the instructions.

### Instructions

1. Open the `exercise1.py` script present under the `PROJECT` folder.
2. Navigate to **Terminal > New Terminal** execute the **`python3 exercise1.py`** command to run the `exercise1.py` script.
3. Modify the script under the `# Modify the line below` comment to apply explicit type casting and ensure each variable matches its intended data type.
4. Save your changes by navigating to **File > Save**.

## Exercise 2: Calculate and Display Total Bill with Type Casting

In this exercise, you will prompt the user for item prices and then use type casting to correctly calculate and display the bill total.

### Instructions

1. Open the `exercise2.py` script present under the `PROJECT` folder.
2. Navigate to **Terminal > New Terminal** execute the **`python3 exercise2.py`** command to run the `exercise2.py` script.
3. Modify the script under the `# Modify the line below` comment to ensure the total bill is calculated and displayed accurately. Use type casting as needed to handle data types correctly.
4. Save your changes by going to **File > Save**.

## Final Step: Submitting Your Work

- After completing each exercise, save your files by selecting **File -> Save**.
- When ready, select **Submit Assignment** in the lab toolbar.
- Your code will be autograded, and feedback will be available in the **Grades** tab or under **My Submission** in your Programming Assignment.
